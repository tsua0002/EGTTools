    This function transform a payoff matrix in full format to a pairwise format.

    The transformation should only be done if it is possible to assume that there will always be
    at most 2 strategies in a group at a given time. An example of this would be when calculating
    the Small Mutation Limit (SML) of the Pairwise Moran Process. In this case, we do not need to
    know the payoffs for each strategy for any group composition (i.e., when there are more than
    2 strategies in the group), but only for all possible combinations of each 2 strategies.

    To be able to represent this in a nb_strategies x nb_strategies square matrix, we make each
    entry of the matrix a function, which will return the payoff of the strategy given k players
    adopting strategy i and N - k players adopting strategy j.

    Parameters
    ----------
    nb_strategies : int
        Number of strategies in the population
    game : egttools.numerical.games.AbstractGame
        A game object which contains the method `payoff` which returns the payoff of
        a strategy given a group composition.

    Returns
    -------
    numpy.ndarray[numpy.float64[m,m]]
        Returns the payoff matrix in shape nb_strategies x nb_strategies, and each entry of the payoff

        a group composition with k members of strategy i and N - k members of strategy j.
